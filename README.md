**Project 4** : Predict buildings' energy consumption needs 

## Project Description:

Implementation of a supervised learning algorithm (regression) to predict building energy consumption in Seattle:

* Creation of a data cleaning pipeline
* Training (with crossvalidation) and compare several algorithm (Lasso/Ridge, SupportVectorRegressor, MLPRegressor, RandomForest, GradientBoosting)
* Hyperparameters optimisation (GridSearchCV)
* Feature importance study (RFE Sklearn function + RFE Homemade function)

Dataset used : <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/sea-building-energy-benchmarking#2015-building-energy-benchmarking.csv'>Data Seattle</a>

## Assessed Skills:

* Transform features appropriately to use them in a supervised learning algorithm
* Tune hyperparameters of an algorithm to enhance its performance
* Evaluate performances of a supervised algorithm
* Implement a sector-specific relevent machine learning model
